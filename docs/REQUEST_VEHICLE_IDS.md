**Subject:** Request for Vehicle Type IDs - API Integration

---

Dear Onro Support Team,

I am integrating with the Onro API and need to implement dynamic vehicle type selection for my customers.

Could you please provide me with:

1. **List of all available Vehicle Types** in my account
2. **Vehicle Type IDs** for each type
3. **Vehicle Type Names** (e.g., Bike, Car, Van, etc.)

**Current Vehicle Type ID I'm using:**
`0CRbnzYnv4_rQA53K7O5z`

**Example format I need:**
```
- Bike: ID_HERE
- Car: ID_HERE  
- Van: ID_HERE
```

This information will help me provide better service to my customers by allowing them to choose the appropriate vehicle type for their delivery.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

3. Look for **Vehicle Types**, **Fleet Management**, or **Services**
4. Copy the IDs from there
